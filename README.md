# Cookie Clicker!

 ###  Cookie Clicker is an incremental web-browser game developed by Orteil. 
 The goal of the game is to produce as many cookies 
 (by clicking on the Big Cookie
  and buying buildings to produce them) as you can.


###  Missions objectives:
*   JavaScript skills.
*   Incremental skills.
*  Cookie skills.

<p> I think i have complet the objectives of this mission <br>
but still have a lot to learn and of course  wait the opinion of my coaches. 

# Step 1: base structure!
We use the 3 main coding <br> 
languages to creat the clicker game.

* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript

# Step 2: Prepare the JavaScript!

## To prepare JS we need to follow a few steps. 
 - [x] In your JavaScript prepare variables to 
 allow you to control your button and label.

  # Step 3: increase the score

 -[x] When you click the button, increase the variable storing the score by 1, then display the current score inside the label.

# Step 4: make a multiplier
 -[x] Add another button which will act as a multiplier. When called this button will permanently multiply the number of points per click, by two for example.

# Step 5: price of multiplier
-[x] The multiplier allows you to have a big score quickly, that shouldn’t be free, it should be a purchase made with the current player score.

# Step 6: no credit
-[x] You can’t make credit, meaning that the player cannot have a negative score. Think about updating the score display after a purchase.

# Step 7: display multiplier counter
-[x] Display the counter within the multiplier. For example, if the counter is worth 5, then the button should display something like multiplier x5.

# Step 8: increase the cost
-[x] Buying a lot of multiplier is way too easy. For more fun, make it so that each time a multiplier is purchased the cost of buying a new one is increased.

# Step 9: display the cost
-[x] In the text of the multiplier button you should also have the price of the upgrade.

# Step 10: auto-clicker
-[X] Implement a new improvement to buy, the auto-click. As the name might suggest this bonus will automatically add a click to your score each x seconds.
